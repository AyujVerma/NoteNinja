# NoteNinja
A large number of lectures are inaccessible to students with disabilities, especially when going back to review recorded lectures that often don't have subtitles.

That's why we came up with NoteNinja: combining a professorâ€™s presentation with their live lecture to give students a condensed version of the notes for the day. Simply upload the presentation deck and an audio recording of the lecture and within seconds, you get a PDF with items from the slide deck annotated by the professor's live thoughts!

If a professor decides to ramble on some tangent, we give that chain of thought it's own section from what the main points are in the slide deck.
